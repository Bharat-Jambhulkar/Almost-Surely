## Project Reflection

While writing simulation code for few concepts, I realized that the project would benefit from a **book-like, structured approach**. This became particularly evident while working on the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**, where multiple perspectives and variations of the same idea need to be presented together. Organizing the content in a chapter-wise manner makes the project easier to follow, maintain, and extend.

The idea is inspired by the book:  
*Probability [Probability Theory: An Introduction Using R by Shailaja R. Deshmukh and Akanksha S. Kashikar](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781032619057/probability-theory-shailaja-deshmukh-akanksha-kashikar)


The book introduces fundamental concepts in probability theory along with their implementation/simulation using the **R programming language**. In this project, the same ideas are implemented in **Python**, aiming to replicate the structure of the original R code while leveraging Python-based tools.
